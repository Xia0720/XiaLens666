                Hi, I’m Xia. I’m a photography enthusiast from China, currently at the beginning of my journey behind the lens.
                I have a deep passion for capturing people, nature, and the beauty of fleeting moments. Through my photos, I aim to
                freeze time, preserve memories, and celebrate the simple joys of life. This website is not only a collection of my
                favorite shots, but also a visual diary of my growth as a photographer. I hope my work brings you a sense of beauty
                and inspiration — let’s embrace the magic in every moment, together.
            </p>
