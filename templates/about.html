        <p>Hi, I’m Xia.<br><br>
        I’m a photography enthusiast from China, currently at the beginning of my journey behind the lens.<br><br>
        I have a deep passion for capturing people, nature, and the beauty of fleeting moments.<br><br>
        Through my photos, I aim to freeze time, preserve memories, and celebrate the simple joys of life.<br><br>
        This website is not only a collection of my favorite shots, but also a visual diary of my growth as a photographer.<br><br>
        I hope my work brings you a sense of beauty and inspiration—let’s embrace the magic in every moment, together.
